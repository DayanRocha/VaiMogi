# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive route management functionality to the driver section of the school transportation application. It provides drivers with the ability to view, create, and manage their assigned routes through an intuitive interface that includes route registration, execution tracking, and historical records.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a school bus driver, I want to access a routes list screen from the driver section, so that I can manage all my route-related activities in one centralized location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the driver navigates to the "rotas" (routes) tab THEN the system SHALL display a routes list screen
2. WHEN the routes list screen loads THEN the system SHALL display three main options: "Cadastrar rota" (Register Route), "Rotas em execução" (Routes in Execution), and "Histórico de rotas" (Route History)
3. WHEN the driver views the routes list THEN the system SHALL present the options in a clear, mobile-friendly interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a school bus driver, I want to register new routes with essential details, so that I can create and organize my transportation schedules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the driver clicks on "Cadastrar rota" THEN the system SHALL open a route registration form (popup or new screen)
2. WHEN the route registration form opens THEN the system SHALL display fields for "Nome da rota" (Route Name), "Horário da rota" (Route Time), and "Dias da semana" (Days of the Week)
3. WHEN the driver enters route information THEN the system SHALL validate that all required fields are completed
4. WHEN the driver selects days of the week THEN the system SHALL provide individual day selection checkboxes
5. WHEN the driver wants to select multiple days quickly THEN the system SHALL provide a "Semana toda" (Whole Week) option that selects all seven days
6. WHEN the driver wants to select only business days THEN the system SHALL provide a "Dias úteis" (Weekdays) option that selects Monday through Friday
7. WHEN the driver saves a new route THEN the system SHALL store the route information and return to the routes list

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a school bus driver, I want to view routes currently in execution, so that I can monitor and manage my active transportation duties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the driver clicks on "Rotas em execução" THEN the system SHALL display a list of currently active routes
2. WHEN viewing routes in execution THEN the system SHALL show route name, current status, and relevant timing information
3. WHEN no routes are currently in execution THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a school bus driver, I want to access my route history, so that I can review past transportation activities and maintain records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the driver clicks on "Histórico de rotas" THEN the system SHALL display a list of previously completed routes
2. WHEN viewing route history THEN the system SHALL show route name, completion date, and basic route details
3. WHEN the route history is empty THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message
4. WHEN viewing route history THEN the system SHALL organize routes in reverse chronological order (most recent first)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a school bus driver using a mobile device, I want the route management interface to be responsive and touch-friendly, so that I can easily interact with it while on the go.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the driver accesses the routes list on a mobile device THEN the system SHALL display a mobile-optimized interface
2. WHEN the driver interacts with form elements THEN the system SHALL provide appropriately sized touch targets
3. WHEN the route registration form is displayed THEN the system SHALL be easily usable on mobile screens
4. WHEN the driver uses the day selection controls THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback for selected/unselected states
